# One more Django + DRF starter (template).
An highly optioned Django + DRF Github template (always evolving)

Why? Because I can. :)
Kidding. Not Kidding. Learning purposes also.

As of we have:

- Poetry as package manager

- Pre-commit hooks only on push (to keep the commits loop fast).
Main hooks:
  - ruff
  - ruff-format
  - isort
  - mypy
  - pyupgrade
  - commitizen (commit-msg)

[Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) besides linting commit messages is used for:
- Bump versions
- Generate changelogs
- Update project's version

Amongo others.
